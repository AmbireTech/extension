The end users are solely responsible and liable for any and all of your actions and inactions on the application and all gains and losses sustained from their use of the Ambire Wallet. The end user hereby indemnifies Ambire Wallet contributors, authors and operators in full for any and all negative consequences that might arise from the use of the application due to the lack of control over the peer-to-peer activities.

The use of the Wallet, however, may be legally prohibited or technically restricted in certain territories and countries. End users are solely responsible to inform themselves of such legal restrictions and to comply with the legal norms applicable for them. Technically speaking, due to the open-source nature of Ambire Wallet, access to your funds will always be possible as long as you retain access to any of the private keys controlling the account. The activities conducted by the end users on the Wallet may result in the creation of a taxable event and end users may be objects of tax and fee payments to public authorities in different countries depending on the legal regulations. End users are obliged to inform themselves about such requirements and are solely responsible for their payments.'
